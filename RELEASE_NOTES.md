# Release Notes

RichTextKit will use semver after 1.0. 

Until then, minor updates may remove deprecated features and introduce breaking changes.



## 0.9.9

This release adds a lot of new `RichTextAction` cases and adjusts the context and coordinator subscription.

This release also deprecates `RichTextAttributeReader` and `RichTextAttributeWriter` functionality that are not used by the library, in favor of `RichTextViewComponent`, to reduce the complexity of the library. 

Until now, these functions mostly did the same thing, but sometimes the `RichTextViewComponent` have to use its text storage or layout manager, or update the typing attributes. This caused the code to diverge and mostly identical copies had co-exist, where the reader and writer versions were not even used by the library.

By deprecating these functions, we can simplify the library in 1.0, and focus more on unifying the different `RichTextViewComponent` implementations (`UITextView` in iOS and `NSTextView` in macOS), rather than providing a low level string handling interface.

This release addresses some performance changes, by trying to minimize the number of redraws.

As a result, the `RichTextContext`'s `selectedRange` is no longer observable, since that caused every input or text position change to redraw the entire app. The library and demo app however still updates way to often, and too much. For instance, switching between having a selected range and not should only redraw the copy button, but now updates the entire screen. If you know how to minimize this, please reach out.
